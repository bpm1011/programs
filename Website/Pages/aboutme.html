    <p class=about>Hi! My name is Brandon McNeil.
    <br>
    <br>
    Let me take a moment of your time to tell you about my story. I grew up in a small town in New Hampshire.
    Youngest in my family. When I was 10, I learned that I was exceptionally good at lacrosse.
    Throughout my highschool year I continued to work on my craft. After I graduated I went straight to the pros.
    I have had a great career in the MLL (Major League Lacrosse). The position I play is attack and I'm a scoring machine. You can see all my stats and acomplishments on the achievments page.

    Below is a link to a video highlighting some of my finest plays. Please enjoy.
